## Phenomena Explanation from Text 🕵️‍♂️

Source code and dataset for "Phenomena Explanation from Text:Unsupervised Learning of Interpretable andStatistically Significant Knowledge".

<b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Learning knowledge from text is becoming increasingly important as the amount of unstructured content on the Web rapidly grows. Despite recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding, the explanation of phenomena from textual documents is still a difficult and poorly addressed problem. Additionally, current NLP solutions often require labeled data, are domain-dependent, and based on black box models. In this paper, we introduce POIROT, a new descriptive text mining methodology for phenomena explanation. POIROT is designed to provide accurate and interpretable results in unsupervised settings, quantifying them based on their statistical significance. We evaluated POIROT on a medical case study, with the aim of learning the "voice of patients" from short social posts. Taking Esophageal Achalasia as a reference, we automatically derived scientific correlations with an F1 score of about 79\% and built useful explanations on the patients' point of view on topics such as symptoms, treatments, drugs, and foods.
